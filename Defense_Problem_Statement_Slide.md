# Problem Statement
## PSWR-DRL: Power Saving Wireless Routing based on Deep Reinforcement Learning

---

### Key Problems

• **Energy Hole & Uneven Depletion**
  - Nodes near sink points drain energy faster, creating network bottlenecks and premature failures

• **Static Routing Limitations**  
  - Traditional static routing fails to adapt to evolving energy levels and topology changes, further accelerating network degradation

• **Scalability and Performance Degradation**
  - Network performance deteriorates significantly as network size and complexity increase

### Our Solution Approach

• **Deep Q-Network Based Intelligent Routing**
  - Neural network makes real-time routing decisions based on energy levels and network conditions

• **Adaptive Power Management**
  - Node-specific sleep scheduling and intelligent transmission control to prevent energy holes

• **Multi-Objective Optimization**
  - Comprehensive framework simultaneously optimizing energy efficiency, network lifetime, and data delivery quality
