#### 3. Deep Reinforcement Learning Implementation

##### Deep Q-Network (DQN) Architecture

The PSWR-DRL system implements a sophisticated DQN with the following specifications:

-   **Neural Network**: 2-layer fully connected network (64 neurons per layer)
-   **State Space**: 9-dimensional feature vector:
    1. Normalized energy level (0-1)
    2. Distance to cluster head (normalized)
    3. Distance to sink node (normalized)
    4. Hop count to destination (normalized)
    5. Data transmission urgency (0-1)
    6. Network congestion level (0-1)
    7. Sleep pressure indicator (0-1)
    8. Cluster health status (0-1)
    9. Temporal factor for diurnal patterns (0-1)

-   **Action Space**: 3 discrete actions
    1. Forward to Cluster Head
    2. Forward directly to Sink
    3. Enter Sleep Mode

-   **Reward Function**: Multi-objective optimization
    ```python
    def calculate_reward(self, node, action, success):
        reward = 0.5 if success else -1.0
        energy_reward = 0.5 * (node.energy / node.initial_energy)
        lifetime_reward = 0.5 * (alive_nodes / total_nodes)
        distance_reward = distance_based_efficiency
        return reward + energy_reward + lifetime_reward + distance_reward
    ```

##### DQN Training Parameters

```python
# Hyperparameters optimized for WSN routing
BATCH_SIZE = 32           # Experience replay batch size
GAMMA = 0.99              # Discount factor for future rewards
EPS_START = 0.9           # Initial exploration rate
EPS_END = 0.05            # Final exploration rate
EPS_DECAY = 200           # Exploration decay rate
TARGET_UPDATE = 10        # Target network update frequency
MEMORY_SIZE = 10000       # Experience replay buffer size
```

#### 4. Power Saving Mechanisms

##### Adaptive Sleep Scheduling

The PSWR-DRL system implements node-specific sleep scheduling with intelligent wake-up mechanisms:

```python
def update_mode(self, send_permission, sleep_threshold, current_time):
    # Node-specific sleep threshold variation (0-4 additional threshold)
    node_sleep_threshold = sleep_threshold + (self.node_id % 5)
    
    if self.no_send_count >= node_sleep_threshold:
        self.mode = NodeMode.SLEEP
        # Variable sleep duration (0-90% variation)
        sleep_variation = 1 + (self.node_id % 7) * 0.15
        sleep_duration = int(SLEEP_DURATION * sleep_variation)
        # Anti-synchronization randomization
        sleep_duration += random.randint(-5, 5)
        self.sleep_until = current_time + sleep_duration
```

##### Intelligent Data Transmission Control

```python
def should_transmit(self, sensor_data, change_threshold):
    # Node-specific sensitivity (0-150% variation)
    node_sensitivity = 1 + (self.node_id % 6) * 0.3
    node_threshold = change_threshold * node_sensitivity
    
    data_diff = abs(sensor_data - self.last_data)
    should_send = data_diff > node_threshold
    
    # Probabilistic transmission for anti-synchronization
    if not should_send and random.random() < 0.02:
        should_send = True
    
    return should_send
```

## Deep Reinforcement Learning Implementation

### DQN Agent Architecture

The core of PSWR-DRL is implemented through a sophisticated Deep Q-Network agent:

```python
class DQLAgent:
    def __init__(self, state_size=9, action_size=3):
        self.policy_net = DQLNetwork(state_size, action_size)
        self.target_net = DQLNetwork(state_size, action_size)
        self.memory = ReplayMemory(MEMORY_SIZE)
        self.optimizer = optim.Adam(self.policy_net.parameters(), lr=0.001)
```

### Experience Replay and Learning

The system implements experience replay for stable learning:

```python
def replay(self):
    if len(self.memory) < self.batch_size:
        return
    
    batch = self.memory.sample(self.batch_size)
    
    # Compute Q(s_t, a) - current Q values
    curr_q = self.policy_net(states).gather(1, actions)
    
    # Compute max Q(s_{t+1}, a) - next state Q values
    next_q = self.target_net(next_states).max(1)[0].unsqueeze(1).detach()
    
    # Compute expected Q values using Bellman equation
    expected_q = rewards + (1 - dones) * self.gamma * next_q
    
    # Optimize using Smooth L1 Loss
    loss = nn.SmoothL1Loss()(curr_q, expected_q)
    self.optimizer.zero_grad()
    loss.backward()
    self.optimizer.step()
```

## Power Saving Mechanisms

### Multi-Level Energy Conservation

PSWR-DRL implements a comprehensive energy conservation strategy:

### Energy Model

The energy consumption model considers multiple factors:

```python
#### 1. Energy-Aware Node Operations

```python
# Optimized energy parameters for PSWR-DRL
NODE_INITIAL_ENERGY = 100  # Joules initial energy per node
POWER_ACTIVE = 0.1         # Joules per second (active mode)
POWER_SLEEP = 0.05         # Joules per second (sleep mode - 50% savings)
POWER_SEND = 0.3           # Joules per transmission
POWER_RECEIVE = 0.2        # Joules per reception
```

#### 2. Node-Specific Energy Diversity

The PSWR-DRL system implements heterogeneous energy consumption patterns:

```python
def reduce_energy(self, activity_type):
    # Create realistic node diversity (0-30% variation)
    node_efficiency = 1 + (self.node_id % 7) * 0.05
    energy_cost *= node_efficiency
    
    # Minimal base consumption to enable effective sleep
    base_energy_loss = POWER_ACTIVE * 0.001
    
    # Node-specific base energy variation (0-80% difference)
    node_base_factor = 1 + (self.node_id % 5) * 0.2
    base_energy_loss *= node_base_factor
    
    # Apply differential energy consumption based on mode
    if activity_type == "sleep":
        energy_cost += base_energy_loss * 0.05  # 95% energy reduction
    else:
        energy_cost += base_energy_loss
```

#### 3. Cluster Head Energy Management

Cluster heads implement enhanced energy management:

```python
def reduce_energy(self, activity_type):
    # Base energy consumption
    success = super().reduce_energy(activity_type)
    
    # Additional cluster head responsibilities (minimized)
    if success and self.is_alive():
        extra_consumption = POWER_ACTIVE * 0.02  # 2% additional cost
        
        # Time-based scaling for realistic degradation
        if hasattr(self, 'simulation_time_ratio'):
            extra_consumption *= (1 + self.simulation_time_ratio * 0.1)
        
        self.energy -= extra_consumption
```

### Network Topology Optimization

#### Strategic Node Deployment

PSWR-DRL employs intelligent node placement for optimal network coverage:

```python
def generate_strategic_node_positions(self):
    # Create structured deployment with controlled randomization
    grid_spacing_x = self.max_longitude / (math.sqrt(self.num_nodes) + 1)
    grid_spacing_y = self.max_latitude / (math.sqrt(self.num_nodes) + 1)
    
    for i in range(self.num_nodes):
        # Calculate grid-based position
        grid_x = (i % int(math.sqrt(self.num_nodes))) * grid_spacing_x + grid_spacing_x
        grid_y = (i // int(math.sqrt(self.num_nodes))) * grid_spacing_y + grid_spacing_y
        
        # Add controlled randomization for realistic deployment
        x = grid_x + random.uniform(-grid_spacing_x/3, grid_spacing_x/3)
        y = grid_y + random.uniform(-grid_spacing_y/3, grid_spacing_y/3)
```

#### Dynamic Cluster Head Selection

The system implements optimal cluster head selection based on multiple criteria:

```python
def select_optimal_cluster_heads(self):
    # K-means inspired cluster head selection
    # Divide network area into regions for balanced coverage
    region_width = self.max_longitude / math.sqrt(self.num_clusters)
    region_height = self.max_latitude / math.sqrt(self.num_clusters)
    
    # Select nodes closest to regional centers
    for i in range(self.num_clusters):
        center_x = region_x + region_width/2
        center_y = region_y + region_height/2
        # Find optimal node for cluster head role
```

---

## Experimental Methodology

### Dataset Integration

PSWR-DRL utilizes real-world WSN sensor data for validation:

```python
class DatasetLoader:
    def __init__(self, dataset_path):
        self.dataset_info = {
            'transmission_period': 6,  # seconds
            'columns': {
                'temperature_mean': 11,
                'humidity_mean': 13,
                'voltage_mean': 15,
                'lqi_mean': 2,
                'path_length_mean': 8
            }
        }
```
