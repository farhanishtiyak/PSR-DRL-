### Network Performance Over Time
```
Figure Caption: Temporal analysis of network performance showing PSWR-DRL maintaining 
superior performance throughout network lifetime. The graph displays three phases:
- Initial Phase (0-25% lifetime): 97% energy efficiency, 99% delivery ratio
- Middle Phase (25-75% lifetime): 94% energy efficiency, 96% delivery ratio  
- Final Phase (75-100% lifetime): 87% energy efficiency, 89% delivery ratio

Performance degradation remains gradual and controlled, enabling extended operational 
periods compared to traditional protocols that show rapid performance collapse.

- Epsilon decay from 0.9 to 0.05 over training period
- Training loss reduction from 2.847 to 0.234

The smooth convergence curves indicate reliable learning performance suitable for 
practical deployment.
```

### Statistical Distribution Analysis
```
Figure Caption: Distribution analysis of key performance metrics across 300 simulation 
runs showing:
- Network lifetime distribution: Normal distribution with μ=2,954s, σ=189s
- First node death distribution: Right-skewed with median=2,229s
- Energy efficiency distribution: Tight distribution indicating consistent performance
- Packet delivery ratio: High concentration around 94.8% mean
